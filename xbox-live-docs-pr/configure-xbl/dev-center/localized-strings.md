# Configuring localized strings in Partner Center

To localize all your Xbox Live configurations to all the languages that your game supports, you can use the **Localized strings** page in Partner Center.
All of the service configurations that you have created on any of the subsequent Xbox Live pages will be added to the file that you would download.

You can use [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) to configure the localized strings in all languages associated with your game.

Add configuration by doing the following:

1. In Partner Center, click **Services** > **Xbox Live** > **Localized strings**.

   The **Localized strings** section for your title appears.

2. Click the **Download** button.

   A `localization.xml` file is downloaded onto your local machine.

3. You can add the localized strings by duplicating the <Value locale="en-US">Mazes Played</Value> tag and changing the value of the locale to the language of your choice and the value of the localized string.  To avoid errors, you must have at least one value tag within the developer display locale.

4. Once you have added all the localized strings, you can upload the file by dragging or browsing your local machine.

The following errors might appear when you upload the localization.xml file:

| Error | Reason |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| Failed XSD Validation: The element 'LocalizedString' in namespace 'http://config.mgt.xboxlive.com/schema/localization/1' cannot contain text. List of possible elements expected: 'Value' in namespace 'http://config.mgt.xboxlive.com/schema/localization/1' | This occurs when the XML document is malformed |
| Localization string is missing an entry for the developer display locale | This occurs when a localized string is missing an entry whose locale does not match the dev display locale |
| Failed XSD Validation: The 'locale' attribute is invalid - The value ' ' is invalid according to its datatype 'http://config.mgt.xboxlive.com/schema/localization/1:NonEmptyString' - The Pattern constraint failed. | This occurs when a localized string is missing the locale value in the <Value> tag|
