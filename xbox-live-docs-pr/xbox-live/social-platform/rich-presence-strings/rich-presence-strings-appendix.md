# Rich Presence appendix

You can use Player Stats from the Data platform in Rich Presence strings.


## Data platform

The basics of the Data platform are part of the "Entertainment as a Service" initiative.
Everything in a game can be described as events, with attributes associated with those events.

You can configure statistics and state values that are important to the game's experience in the service.

Example statistics:
-   Number of kills
-   Number of side quests completed
-   Number of coins collected
-   Number of miles driven

Example state data:
-   Current map
-   Current X, Y, Z coordinates
-   Current weapon

For more information, see [Player Stats](../../leaderboards-and-stats-2017/player-stats.md).
