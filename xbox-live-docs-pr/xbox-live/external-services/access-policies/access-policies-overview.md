# Overview of configuring access policies

Configuring access policies to allow other apps, games, and services to access a title's Xbox Live settings.

You can use [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) to allow other services, games, and apps to access your title's Xbox Live settings and data. For example, you may want a web service to display leaderboards on your website, or you may have a companion app that can access the game's title storage to view or modify saved game data.

By default, only the title itself can access the settings and data stored on the Xbox Live service. You can change this by configuring access policies in Partner Center.
