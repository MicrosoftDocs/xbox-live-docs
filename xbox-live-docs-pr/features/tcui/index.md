# Title-callable UI (TCUI)

> [!NOTE]
> This is preliminary documentation.

Title-callable UI (TCUI) enables your game code to call pre-defined user interface displays.

The Xbox Live TCUI supports the following:
* Style consistent with RS5 Gamebar
* Tailored to direct input (keyboard/mouse/touch)
* Universal profile card across Gamebar, TCUI, Official Clubs
* Inline messaging
* Limited Game theming (TCUI uses TitleID to fetch existing art)
* Advanced Game theming (Game preconfigures more extensive styling)


TCUI provides the following functions.

|---------|-------------|
| `ShowProfileCardForUserAsync` | Show me-view or you-view profile card for a specific profile. |
