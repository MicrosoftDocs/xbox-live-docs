# Clubs

> [!NOTE]
> This is preliminary documentation.

Clubs is one of the Xbox Live Social features, to easily integrate your game's teams, clans, and communities.

General-purpose clubs in Xbox Live are focused on games and interests.
Clubs are created and managed by gamers to socialize and play with other like-minded gamers.


## Benefits

Gamers engage more when they find a like-minded community.
Being in a club corresponds with 40% more engagement on Xbox Live, and more friends every month.

Higher engagement means more daily logins, more time in games, and more purchases.
