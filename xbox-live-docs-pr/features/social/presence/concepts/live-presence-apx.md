# Rich Presence appendix

You can use Player Stats from the Player Data in Rich Presence strings.


## Player Data

The basics of Player Data are part of the "Entertainment as a Service" initiative.
Everything in a game can be described as events, with attributes associated with those events.

You can configure statistics and state values that are important to the game's experience in the service.

Example statistics:
-   Number of kills
-   Number of side quests completed
-   Number of coins collected
-   Number of miles driven

Example state data:
-   Current map
-   Current X, Y, Z coordinates
-   Current weapon

See [Stats & Leaderboards](../../../player-data/stats-leaderboards/live-stats-leaderboards-nav.md).
