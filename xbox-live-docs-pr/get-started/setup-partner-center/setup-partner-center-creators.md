# Setting up a game at Partner Center, for Creators

To add Xbox Live functionality to your game, start by setting up an app in Partner Center, by following the steps below.


## Prerequisite: Become a Creator

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Prerequisite steps for Creators:
   > Create a Dev Account (also called a Partner Center account).
   > To create a Dev Account, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/mpn-create-a-partner-center-account" target="_blank">Create a Partner Center account</a> at the Partner Center documentation site.


<!--===========================================================-->
## 1. Create a new app

At Partner Center, create a new app representing your game, as follows.

1. Go to <a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/" target="_blank">Partner Center</a>.

   The Partner Center dashboard appears, showing the "Overview" page, within the "WINDOWS" section.

2. Click the **Create a new app** button.

   The page "Create your app by reserving a name" appears.

   ![The "Create your app by reserving a name" page](images/pc_createappreservename_no_opts.png)

3. In the text box, enter the name of your product.
   You can change the name later.

4. If you see option buttons **Create this product in a sandbox** and **Do not create this product in a sandbox**, you must select the option button **Do not create this product in a sandbox**.

5. Click the **Reserve product name** button.

   The "App overview" page appears.

6. Click the **Start your submission** button.

   The "Submission #" page appears, showing the submission number; for example, "Submission 1".

   ![The "Submission #" page before setting the Category to "Games"](images/pc_cr_initl_submission_pg.png)

   In the "Xbox Live Creators Program" section of the page, the message appears:
   "To enable Xbox Live Creators Program, the product's category (on the Properties page) must be Games."

   Your app has now been created at Partner Center and is awaiting being Xbox Live-enabled.


<!--===========================================================-->
## 2. Enable Xbox Live for the game

1. In the "Submission #" page, click the **Properties** section.

   The "Properties" page appears.

   ![The "Properties" page before setting the Category to "Games"](images/pc_cr_initl_properties_pg.png)

2. In the **Category and subcategory** section, in the **Pick a category** drop-down list, select the **Games** category.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Do not select a category other than Games, or else the "Xbox Live" options won't be available.

   Because you selected Games, the "Genre(s) section appears.

3. In the **Genre(s)** section, select one or more check boxes.

   <!-- todo: confirm -->
   Skip the other fields for now.

4. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and click the **Save** button.

   The "Submission #" page reappears, and the "Xbox Live Creators Program" section of the page is now available.

7. In the **Xbox Live game name** text box, enter the name of your game.
   This can be the same as the name of the app you specified at the beginning, but it doesn't need to be the same.

8. Select the platforms that you would like to enable the Xbox Live Services for.
   Both **Xbox One** and **Desktop** are selected by default.

8. Click the **Confirm** button.

   Below the Confirm button, the message temporarily appears:
   "Your product is being Xbox Live enabled. This may take a few minutes."

   Then the "Xbox Live Creators Program" page appears.

You've now completed the initial setup of your game.
