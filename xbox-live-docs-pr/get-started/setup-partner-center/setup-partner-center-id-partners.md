# Setting up a game at Partner Center, for Managed Partners

To add Xbox Live functionality to your game, start by setting up an app in Partner Center, by following the steps below.


## Prerequisite: Become a Creator or an ID@Xbox partner

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Prerequisite steps for ID@Xbox partners:
   > 1. Prepare a prototype of your game, such as a demo and screen captures.
   > 2. If you aren't already an ID@Xbox partner, apply to the ID@Xbox program. An ID@Xbox partner is a Managed Partner. To apply to become an ID@Xbox partner, see <a href="https://www.xbox.com/developers/id" target="_blank">Welcome to ID@Xbox</a> at Xbox.com. Follow the instructions at that site, which will result in a Microsoft Partner Center account being generated for you.


<!--===========================================================-->
## 1. Create a new app

Next, at Partner Center, create a new app, as follows.

1. Go to <a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/" target="_blank">Partner Center</a>.

   The Partner Center dashboard appears, showing the "Overview" page, within the "WINDOWS" section.

   The page "Create your app by reserving a name" appears.

3. In the text box, enter the name of your product.
   You can change the name later.

4. Click the check box **Create this product in a sandbox**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > For ID@Xbox partners, to enable Xbox Live functionality, you **MUST** select the option button **Create this product in a sandbox**, the first time through this process.
   > You won't be able to select this option button later.
   > (Do not select the check box "Do not create this product in a sandbox".)

   Note which sandbox you selected, for later.

8. Click the **Create submission** button.

## 2. Contact your Microsoft Representative to enable your game

1. In Partner Center, select your game.  

   The "App overview" page appears.

3. Copy the **Store ID**.

4. Contact your Microsoft representative to ask them to add Xbox Live capability to your title.
   Include the store ID.
   For example:

   * **Subject**: Need to enable game for Xbox Live

   * **Body**: "Hi support, I would like to enable my Partner Center product.  The store ID is [your game's store ID]."

   Your Microsoft representative emails you; for example: "You can now enable your product in Partner Center."

## 3. Enable Xbox Live for the game

When you receive the above email from your MS Representative, continue with the following steps.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > 1. Save the URL for this page; for example, add this page to Favorites in the browser.
   > 2. Close the browser, including all of the browser's window instances, to clear the session cache.

4. In the "Xbox Live app name" text box, enter the name of your game.
   You can use the same name as shown at the top of the page, but it doesn't need to be the same.

5. Click the **Enable** button.  

   Below the "Enable" button, a message temporarily appears:
   "Your product is being Xbox Live enabled.  This may take a few minutes."

   After some time, the Xbox Live "Gameplay Setting" page automatically appears.

You've now completed the initial setup of your game.
Your game cannot be tested yet; you need to publish the game first.
To do this, you take the identity information that was generated above, and push that information into the Xbox Live runtime system, as follows.


<!--===========================================================-->
## 4. Publish the game

In Partner Center, with your game selected as in the above procedures, do the following.

1. In the top right, click the **Publish** link.

   The "Publish gameplay settings" dialog box appears.

2. Click the **Confirm** button.

   At the bottom of the dialog box, the message appears: "Publishing configuration..." and then "Publishing configuration finished successfully."

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Though the UI says "finished successfully", the Xbox Live servers can take as long as 30 minutes to replicate the new info.

3. Click the **Close** button.

   The "Publish gameplay settings" dialog box closes, and the "Gameplay Setting" page remains displayed.

The SDK can now be used in an application to sign-in.
