# Setting up basic sign-in for Xbox Live

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Prerequisite step: Set up an IDE with the Xbox Live SDK, for your target platforms. See [Getting started](index.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > This is preliminary documentation.

Now that you've set up an app in Partner Center and have set up an IDE, write code for your game to do basic sign-in to Xbox Live; see [Signing-in using XAL](../using-xbox-live/auth/xal.md).
