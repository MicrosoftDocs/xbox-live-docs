Xbox Live SDK for iOS contains 4 components as "frameworks" that you can reference in your game.

    1. Create a **Frameworks** group inside your project if one does not exist.
    1. Right click the **Frameworks** group, select **Add Files to "{Your Project}"**
    1. Navigate to the directory containing the Xbox Live SDK for iOS, and select all 3 frameworks (libHttpClient.framework, Xal.framework, and Xsapi-c.framework)
        - Check "Copy items if needed"
