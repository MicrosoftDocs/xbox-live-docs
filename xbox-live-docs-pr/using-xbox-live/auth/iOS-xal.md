# Setting up Xcode for sign-in with iOS

Once you have acquired the XAL source code, you will need to set up your iOS development environment.
iOS work can only be done on a Mac in the Xcode development environment.


## Requirements

- Macintosh computer.
- Xcode 9 or later; we recommend the latest version.


## Setup

1. In your Xcode environment, open `Xal.xcworkspace`.

2. To use XAL in your iOS project, include the following projects:

- \External\CompactCoreCLL\CompactCoreCLL.xcodeproj
- \External\libHttpClient\Build\libHttpClient.Apple.C\libHttpClient.xcodeproj
- \Source\Xal\Xal.xcodeproj

To do that, you can drag the projects into the **Project Navigator** of your iOS project.  

![xcode project navigator](../../images/xal/xcode_projectnavigator.png)

3. Link with the resulting binaries in the **Build Phases** settings of your project.  

- libHttpClient.a
- libCompactCoreCLL.a
- libXal.a

4. Navigate to **Build Settings** and add the following paths to your **Header Search Paths** setting:

- ../Source/Xal/Source/Include
- ../External/libHttpClient/Include

![set header search paths](../../images/xal/xcode_buildsettings_headersearchpaths.png)

5. Finally, navigate to the **Keychain Sharing** section of your project **Capabilities** and add "com.microsoft.xal" to the list.

6. At this point, you can build the iOS sample app, as well as integrate XAL code into your iOS project.
