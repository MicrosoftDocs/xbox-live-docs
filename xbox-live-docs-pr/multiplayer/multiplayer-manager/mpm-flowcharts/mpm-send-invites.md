# Inviting another player (flowchart)

The following flowcharts show the flow of inviting another player to join your game.


## Send invites

In the flowchart below, TCUI stands for *Title Callable User Interface*, which represents commonly used UI elements, such as a friend picker for invites.

A system-provided TCUI is available on both Xbox One and Windows 10, or your title can implement a custom TCUI for viewing online friends and inviting them.
