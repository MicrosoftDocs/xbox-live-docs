# XR-074: Loss of Connectivity to Xbox and Partner Services &diams;

Titles must resolve errors with Xbox Live and partner services connectivity. Titles must honor the retry policies set by Xbox Live when attempting to retry a request to the Xbox service after a failure has occurred.  Titles must appropriately manage messaging the user when services are unavailable. For example, if a partner service other than Xbox Live is not available, the game should not indicate that there is an issue with Xbox Live.

## More Information

**Handling Issues With Non Xbox Live Services**

Titles encountering issues with partner services such as non-transient timeouts, network API errors, or missing service configuration that impacts the user experience should alert the user to the specific feature or service that is unavailable. Titles should fail gracefully to a safe state while the user troubleshoots, or to a state in which the user can manually retry.

An example of a user-friendly message is:

>“Sorry, _non-Microsoft service_ is not currently available. Please try again later. For more information, contact _non-Microsoft support contact information_.”

**Handling Issues With Xbox Live Services**

Some functionality might become unavailable if connectivity to an Xbox service is lost. In such instances, titles should use clear, user-friendly messaging to communicate this to users.

If a service is unavailable, titles are permitted to retry their request, but they can do so only within the parameters allowed by Xbox Live. For more information about service resiliency for Xbox One titles, including required HTTP retry and back-off logic, as well as user-interaction guidance for individual services, see Service Interruption Resiliency for Titles.
 

## Recommended Test Cases


**074-01 WAN Disconnection to Xbox Services**

**Test Steps**

**074-07 Dynamic Connectivity Loss**

**Tools Needed**
>1. Fiddler

**Test Steps**
>1. Sign into an Xbox profile and launch the title.

**Fail Examples**
>1. Error displayed implies issues with Microsoft service.
>2.	Non-descriptive error message is displayed.
>3.	Title crashes or becomes unstable.

**074-08 Pre-launch Downtime**
**Tools Needed**
1. Fiddler

**Test Steps**
